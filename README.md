Next mission: Add test user accounts to production app...

The whole invoice system should be functional now. All we need is to add the shows and the utilities to production. It's working remotely for me right now...

Working in Local Machine, get it working in Production:
- [ ] Add Producer Accounts to load on startup
- [ ] Add Administrator Accounts
- [ ] Add utility to add producers, clients and shows to accounts
- [ ] Ensure V has ability to click invoices and see amounts due to everyone

New Development Work to Do:
- [ ] Change Invoice to start on the 15 of each month (think Time.now.day)
  - [ ] Related, https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/scheduler

# Blocks are the heart of a pipeline and are executed sequentially.
# Each block has a task that defines one or more jobs. Jobs define the
# commands to execute.
# See https://docs.semaphoreci.com/article/62-concepts
blocks:
  - name: Setup
    task:
      jobs:
        - name: bundle
          commands:
          # Checkout code from Git repository. This step is mandatory if the
          # job is to work with your code.
          # Optionally you may use --use-cache flag to avoid roundtrip to
          # remote repository.
          # See https://docs.semaphoreci.com/article/54-toolbox-reference#checkout
          - checkout
          # Restore dependencies from cache.
          # Read about caching: https://docs.semaphoreci.com/article/149-caching

          - sem-version ruby 2.6.0
          - bundle install --deployment -j 4 --path vendor/bundle
          # Store the latest version of dependencies in cache,
          # to be used in next blocks and future workflows:

            # restored, but generally this is not the case with other package
            # managers. Installation will not actually run and command will
            # finish quickly:

      # setup steps. We can group them in a prologue.

  # agent configuration here to use e1-standard-8.
